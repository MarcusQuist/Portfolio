# PWC Case - React
**Summary**
1. (Completed)
Create a function that translates all the hobbies into the same naming convention.
You can choose between the following conventions: camelCase, snake_case or PascalCase.
This translation should happen inside of a lifecycle hook on component mount.

2. (Completed)
Create a function/component that renders only the persons with unique hobbies.
Display the persons with some added styling.

3. (Completed)
Use the useReducer hook to create the following functionality
 - Increase the count to the nearest unequal number
 - Decrease the count to the nearest prime number
 - Increase the count using the fibonacci number sequence
 
4. (Completed)
Add styling to the project.
 
# PWC Case - Kafka
**Producer** \
It has been assumed that a Kafka Producer may send more than one record.\
The user is asked to enter a clientId and clientName for each record to be sent.

**Consumer** \
It issumed that new consumers must not be met withprior  data sent to the topic â€“  only the data sent after the consumer has joined. \
In order to run the Kafka Consumer program, a groupId must be given as the first argument.


If you are running the zookeeper and kafka implementation from the PWC_Case folder, be sure to modify the following properties to your own unique folder path:

**zookeeper.properties:**  
#16: dataDir=.../kafka/data/zookeeper\
E.g.: dataDir=C:/Users/Name/Desktop/kafka/data/zookeeper

**server.properties:**  
#60: log.dirs=.../kafka/data/kafka\
E.g. log.dirs=C:/Users/Name/Desktop/kafka/data/kafka

A topic for testing has been created with the following properties:\
kafka-topics --zookeeper 127.0.0.1:2181 --topic new-client --create --partitions 3 --replication-factor 1

# SpotiStats (React)
A React project using the Spotify API to extend a user's functionality.
\
\
**Primary extensions**
* A user can fetch a a personalized playlist generated by Spotify's API from the following criteria:
  * The user's most heard songs since sign-up
  * The user's most heard songs from the past 6 months
  * The user's most heard songs form the past 4 weeks
* A user can fetch recommended songs generated by Spotify's APY from the following criterias:
  * Acousticness / Danceability / Energy / Instrumentalness / Liveness / Popularity / Speechiness / Valence
  * 1-5 specific items must be selected as well, which consists of the following:
    * A track
    * An artist
    * A genre
* The playlist generated from the two options above can be saved directly to the user's Spotify account
* The user can search for songs and add them to an album which can be saved directly to their Spotify account

# Danmarkskortet (Algorithm experience)
"Danmarkskortet" is a project developed during my 2nd semester of my Software Development study. \
**The project goals in short**
  * Develop our own version of Google Maps from scratch.
    * Searching for the shortest routes (Taking transport type into consideration (Car / Bike / Walking)
    * Optimizing the program through algorithms (KD-Tree / Shortest-path algorithms)
    * Visually showing the map through interconnected nodes
    * Visually showing the generated route to the user

\
**My most important contribution to the project**
\
I developed the route-search system. \
This mainly included:
 * Dijkstra Shortest-Path Algorithm
 * Directed Edges
 * Edge Weighted Digraph

Furthermore, the algorithms had to be finely tuned to fit to our programs datastructure, which is a whole system of nodes extracted from .OSM files.
