# PWC Case
**Producer**
It has been assumed that a Kafka Producer may send more than one record.\
The user is asked to enter a clientId and clientName for each record to be sent.

**Consumer**
It issumed that new consumers must not be met with all prior data sent to the topic â€“  only the data sent after the consumer has joined. \
In order to run the Kafka Consumer program, a groupId must be given as the first argument.


If you are running the zookeeper and kafka implementation from the PWC_Case folder, be sure to modify the following properties to your own unique folder path:

**zookeeper.properties:**  
#16: dataDir=.../kafka/data/zookeeper\
E.g.: dataDir=C:/Users/Name/Desktop/kafka/data/zookeeper

**server.properties:**  
#60: log.dirs=.../kafka/data/kafka\
E.g. log.dirs=C:/Users/Name/Desktop/kafka/data/kafka

A topic for testing has been created with the following properties:\
kafka-topics --zookeeper 127.0.0.1:2181 --topic new-client --create --partitions 3 --replication-factor 1
